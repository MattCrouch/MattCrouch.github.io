They contain all the logic you need to get up and running in a few commons scenarios.</p>\n<p>While the more common ones are set up by Gatsby themselves, anybody can make a starter. All that is required is a repository URL.</p>\n<p>by default, the Gatsby CLI will use <a href=\"https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-default\"><code>gatsby-starter-default</code></a>. This gives you a couple of placeholder pages and 404 handling to work with. It also contains empty files for common actions like <code>gatsby-node.js</code> so they're set up and ready to go.</p>\n<h1>How do I use a starter?</h1>\n<p>When starting a project, the CLI takes a starter as the final argument. For example:</p>\n<pre><code>gatsby new starter-site https://www.gatsbyjs.org/starters/gatsby-material-starter\n</code></pre>\n<h1>Where can I find a starter?</h1>\n<p>You can grab starters from anywhere, but the best place is the Gatsby <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org/starters/\">Starter Library</a>.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"December 01, 2018","path":"/post/gatsby-starters","title":"Gatsby Starters"}}},"pageContext":{}}
