If they need to be used in more than just one place, this is a good place to put them.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">siteMetadata: {\n  title: \"Gatsby Blog\",\n  description: \"A site all about the wonders of Gatsby\"\n},\n</code></pre>\n<p>There's nothing specific that <em>needs</em> to go in <code>siteMetadata</code>.

For example:</p>\n<pre><code>gatsby new starter-site https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-default\n</code></pre>\n<h1>Where can I find a starter?</h1>\n<p>You can grab starters from anywhere, but the best place is the Gatsby <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org/starters/\">Starter Library</a>.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"December 02, 2018","path":"/post/setting-up-gatsby-config","title":"Setting up Gatsby config"}}},"pageContext":{}}
