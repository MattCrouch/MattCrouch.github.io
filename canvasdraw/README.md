# Canvas Draw

Simple tool to draw and capture on canvas.

Was to be used as part of a project at Hacksoton 7, before getting distracted by the setup of other stuff.

##Â Usage

var sketch = new Sketch(canvas, defaultColor, defaultWidth);

**sketch.getDrawing()**
Returns the sketch as a data URL

**sketch.clear()**
Clears the canvas

**sketch.setColor(hex)**
Sets the colour to be used on the canvas

**sketch.setWidth(width)**
Sets the width of the pen on the canvas
