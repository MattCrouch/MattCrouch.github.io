00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.141
Now and then I think of when we were together

00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:12.821
Like when you said you felt so happy you could die

00:00:14.699 --> 00:00:17.771
Told myself that you were right for me

00:00:18.095 --> 00:00:21.466
But felt so lonely in your company

00:00:21.955 --> 00:00:27.328
But that was love and it's an ache I still remember

00:00:28.858 --> 00:00:35.002
You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness

00:00:36.133 --> 00:00:38.864
Like resignation to the end

00:00:38.864 --> 00:00:40.869
Always the end

00:00:42.859 --> 00:00:46.864
So when we found that we could not make sense

00:00:47.444 --> 00:00:50.281
Well you said that we would still be friends

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.364
But I'll admit that I was glad

00:00:53.513 --> 00:00:56.201
It was over

00:00:57.697 --> 00:01:00.681
But you didn't have to cut me off

00:01:00.968 --> 00:01:05.270
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing

00:01:05.278 --> 00:01:07.603
I don't even need your love

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:11.358
You treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.878
No you didn't have to stoop so low

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.511
Have your friends collect your records and then change your number

00:01:19.901 --> 00:01:22.273
Guess that I don't need that though

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.850
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
